# python-searchengine

Simple search engine implementation in Python for illustrative purposes to go with [this blog post](https://bart.degoe.de/building-a-full-text-search-engine-150-lines-of-code/).

## Requirements

Python 3.7 or greater.

## Usage






Run from the command line (this program will exit afterwards):

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python run.py
Parsing XML took 701.6900851726532 seconds
index_documents took 701.6901140213013 seconds
Index contains 6274026 documents
search took 0.2980232238769531 milliseconds
search took 0.07561087608337402 seconds
search took 0.1850128173828125 milliseconds
search took 0.2769007682800293 seconds
```

Run from interactive console:
```python
Python 3.8.0 (v3.8.0:fa919fdf25, Oct 14 2019, 10:23:27)

## Using a smaller data set

The code will download the complete set of 6.7m Wikipedia abstracts. If you want to play around with a smaller data set, just pick one of the numbered gzip files from https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/ and change the URL in [download.py](https://github.com/bartdegoede/python-searchengine/blob/master/download.py#L5).
